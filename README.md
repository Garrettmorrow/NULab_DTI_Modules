# NULab_DTI_Modules
This repository is a collection of Digital Teaching Integration Initiative modules I have created for Northeastern University's NULab. The repository is ongoing and will be added to as new modules are created.

## Modules:

### Module 1: [FBI API Tutorial](https://github.com/Garrettmorrow/NULab_DTI_Modules/blob/master/FBI_API_module/FBI_API_Module.ipynb)<br>
This module is a module teaching how to use the Federal Bureau of Investigation's API to search and extract data for use in research projects.

### Module 2: [Text Analysis using Python](https://github.com/Garrettmorrow/NULab_DTI_Modules/blob/master/Text_Analysis/Text_Analysis_In_Python.ipynb)<br>
This module is still in progress. It is a module teaching how to use Python for basic text analysis counting words, gerunds, characters, etc. The second part of the module teaches how to use the nltk package for natural language processing.
